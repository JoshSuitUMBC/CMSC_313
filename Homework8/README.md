PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: To calculate a specific matrix function by implementing all functions
                     necessarry to fully solve the problem.
FILES: README.md - to explain the file's contents
       matrixLibrary.cpp - C++ version of matrix library code
       matrixLibrary2.c - C version of matrix library code
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: For the cpp file -
                    g++ matrixLibrary.cpp -o matrix_Library
                    ./matrixLibrary
                    For the c file -
                    gcc matrixLibrary2.c -o matrixLibrary2
                    ./matrixLibrary
TESTING METHODOLOGY: This code solves a specific equation, so all there is to 
                     test is the specific output once ran.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Code is set to answer the specific question asked in example
                        But has the code to answer future possible questions.
